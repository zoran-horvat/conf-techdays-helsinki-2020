# Surviving C# 8 Design with No Nulls
*Source code for conference talk at TechDays Helsinki, March 5-6, 2020*


C# 8 is with us, and it brings long awaited non-nullable reference types syntax. How shall we adapt? Will it feel like standing naked in the rain? Not necessarily; there are several techniques that we can apply to substitute all nulls with proper objects. In this talk, you will learn when and how substitute objects can be used, and when optional objects are a better alternative. You will be equipped with knowledge to remove every trace of nulls in your business applications, and to step firmly into the world of C# 8 programming.
